# Web Design Project

This project is a simple static webpage based on provided design images and requirements on The Odin Project website. The focus of this project was to create a multi-section layout with appropriate HTML and CSS styling, following a structured and efficient approach for development.

## Project Requirements

- **Download Design Images**: The project was based on two design images provided: 
  - **Image One** (Full Design) - overall layout of the webpage
  - **Image Two** (Color and Fonts) - information on color scheme and font usage
  
- **Hero Text**: A prominent hero text section that appears at the top of the webpage.
  
- **Four Main Sections**: The webpage is structured into four main sections plus a footer.
  
- **HTML First, Then CSS**: Content (HTML) was added first, followed by styling (CSS). This allowed for a more efficient workflow, ensuring that all elements were in place before applying styles.

- **One Stylesheet**: The project utilized a single stylesheet (CSS file) for all the styling of the webpage.

- **No Mobile Responsiveness**: The focus was on desktop layout, and mobile responsiveness was not a requirement for this phase.

## Development Process

1. **Setting Up the Project**:
   - Started with creating a basic HTML structure.
   - Included necessary HTML elements such as headings, paragraphs, and containers.
   - Used appropriate tags to define each section of the page (header, main, footer, etc.).

2. **Adding Content**:
   - Added content as per the project requirements, ensuring it matched the information in the design images.
   - Placed the hero text at the top as instructed, making it the focal point of the page.
  
3. **Styling with CSS**:
   - Applied styles according to the color palette and fonts from the design images.
   - Used Flexbox for layout structuring to achieve alignment and positioning of elements, ensuring responsiveness in terms of structure.
   - Kept the CSS concise by using classes and IDs where appropriate to target elements.

4. **Commit Strategy**:
   - Committed early and often during the development process to keep track of progress and ensure proper version control.
   - Used descriptive commit messages to clearly outline changes made to both the HTML and CSS files.

5. **Finalization**:
   - Refined the design and content to match the provided images closely.
   - Ensured the webpage was functional with basic styling applied.

6. **GitHub**:
   - Pushed the final version of the project to GitHub for version control and access.

## Technologies Used

## Key Features

- **Hero Text**: The hero text appears at the top of the page as a prominent statement.
